    #Movie Ticket Booking App#
This is a simple web application for booking movie tickets. It fetches a list of 
films from a local server and displays them to the user for selection. Users can view movie details and buy tickets.


    #Prerequisites#
    Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Web browser with JavaScript enabled.
The backend server providing movie data is running on http://localhost:3000/films


You should see a list of movies with details, and a dropdown menu that you can use to filter the movies by genre (though it's not implemented in the provided code).


       # STEPS#
       The movies are fetched from the server when the page loads.
The movie details, including the movie poster, title, runtime, capacity, showtime, tickets sold, and available tickets, are displayed for each movie.
Users can click the "Buy Ticket" button to book tickets for a movie.# week-3-code-challenge
